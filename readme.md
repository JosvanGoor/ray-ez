# Ray-EZ
This is a raytracer framework i'm writing for fun and to expand my knowledge on math and threaded systems.

Below is a list of things I implemented or am planning to implement, they can be marked as follows:
* !! - This is not implemented but planned
* ! - This is implemented but not tested thouroughly
* \* There is currently a problem with the functionality of this part

## subsystems:
The framework consists of a selection of classes catergorized by function.
* !core: contains some generally used functions and the core class.
* !!main: contians the main-function starting the everything.

### Data
This category contains classes to parse scenes.
* !datanode: This class represents an array/object/value in an json file.
* !!image: This class contains image data and read/write data.
* !json: This file contains json parsing functions
* !stepdocument: This class contains functions used by parsers.

### Math
* !!algebra: contains functions to solve certain formula's
* !math: contains certain commonly used constants and functions
* !matrix4x4: this class represents a 4x4 matrix used for translation and projection
* !vector3: this class represents a 3x1 vector used to contain color and coordinates etc.
* !vector4: ???

### raytracer
This category contains certain classes designed specifically for the raytracer framework.
* !camera: represents a camera in the scene, delivers the rays to be traced.
    + contains data on dof aswell.
* !hit: represents a hit-point where a ray hits a shape.
* !material: represents color and (reflective) characteristics of a material.
* !ray: represents a ray (orgigin, direction) used to determine hits.


### Lights
This category contains light-types.
* !point-light: A light that emits light of a certain color from a certain point

### rendering
This category contains a base-class for a (virtual)renderer object and subclasses to determine the shading
* !!depthshader: (debug-based) this class renders the scene based on the z-buffer.
* !!goochshader: this class renders the scene with gooch shading
    + !!supports toon-edges
* !!normalshader: (debug-based) this class renders the scene based on surface normals.
* !!phongshader: this class renders the scene with phong shading
* !rendermodel: this class is the (virtual) baseclass of all rendermodels.
    + !!supports: refraction
    + !!supports: reflection
    + !!supports: (soft) shadows.

### shapes
This category contains raytracable shapes
* !!disk: class representing a disk, or plane when radius is set to infinite.
* !!mesh: class represents a mesh consisting of a multitude of triangles.
* !shape: baseclass for every shape.
* !!sphere: class representing a perfect sphere.
* !!triangle: class represents a (clockwise) triangle.

#### threads
This category contains threading functionality to ensure maximum performance! :)
* !!task: this (virtual)class represents a "thing" a thread can do.
* !!thread: This (virtual) class represents a general purpose thread.
* !!workerpool: a class that functions as a task-dispensing unit for workerthreads.
